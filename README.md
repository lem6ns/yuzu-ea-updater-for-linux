# yuzu-ea-updater-for-linux
 Poor code thrown together that updates Yuzu on Linux by grabbing an AppImage from [pinEApple](https://pineappleea.github.io/). Downloads keys from [EmuWorld/aio](https://github.com/emuworld/aio/)
 
 If you would like to create a pull request to clean up this, you can absolutely do it.

 Please do <strong>NOT LOOK AT THE CODE!!!</strong> It is very horrible but it works.
